I hope this works as I think it will...

So to make the login work on your own venus account, you need to modify config.php with your personal info. In addition you need to create a table in mysql. This is subject to change until I get the offical table but the one that I currently use is a table called login with 3 columns - UserID, Username, Password. Create a new record with whatever you want and try to log in with said record to test if you want.
